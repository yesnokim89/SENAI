    <h2>Child with Unique Needs</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_education" target="blank" title="특수교육의 정의"><strong>Special Education</strong></a> (also known as <u>special-needs</u> education, aided education, exceptional education, special ed. or SPED) is <br> 
    the practice of educating students in a way that addresses their individual differences and special needs.</p> 
    <HR>
    <p>Ideally, this process involves the individually planned and systematically monitored arrangement of teaching procedures, adapted equipment and <br>
    materials, and accessible settings. These interventions are designed to help individuals with special needs achieve a higher level of personal <br>self-sufficiency and success in school and in their community which may not be available if the student were only given access to a typical classroom education.</p>
